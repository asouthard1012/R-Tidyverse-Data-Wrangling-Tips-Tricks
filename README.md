# R-Tidyverse-Data-Wrangling-Tips-Tricks
This is based on a 60 min presentation I gave to help researchers get all their data wrangling into one location (R). 
All the code is located in the [Data Wrangling - Tips & Tricks.R](https://github.com/lsouthard/R-Tidyverse-Data-Wrangling-Tips-Tricks/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling%20-%20Tips%20%26%20Tricks.R) and you can download the data [here](https://github.com/lsouthard/R-Tidyverse-Data-Wrangling-Tips-Tricks/blob/main/Fake%20Survey%20Data.csv).
